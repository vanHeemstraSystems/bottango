# 100 - Introduction

Taken from the "[Docs](https://s3.us-west-1.amazonaws.com/bottango.com/version+0.6.5/Documentation/BottangoDocumentation.pdf)"

- Bottango is a visual tool for intuitive robot control, with high levels of control and precision . It is meant to replace line upon line of special case behavior and hard coded movements with a WYSIWYG editor, so that an individual’s intent can be more quickly and accurately expressed.
- Bottango operates in real time. If you move the eyebrow of an animatronic face in Bottango, the eyebrow of your robot moves too. If you scrub an animation of your robot arm in Bottango, your robot arm plays the animation at the same time. Bottango is robot agnostic. It’s not supposed to work with only this robot from that manufacturer. It is intended to allow you to define the parameters of your robot, and iterate on the machine itself, not just its behavior.
- If you’ve purchased a Bottango kit, this documentation is principally about using the custom robot Bottango functionality (“Bottango Core”), to animate and control a robot of your own design. There is separate documentation and learning materials for Bottango kits. However, for some more advanced functionality, look to this documentation to understand advanced workflows and uses of a Bottango kit.
